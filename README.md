# MP340
Created a system that allows the MSP430 to display different images and play different songs 
depending on the button pressed on the MSP430.
Programs directly into the MSP430â€™s Ram to display images and produce frequencies on boards 
connected to the MSP430.
Where created due to assignments from my college class.
